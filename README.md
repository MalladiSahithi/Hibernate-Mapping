Hibernate Mapping Guide
This repository provides a guide to understanding Hibernate mappings for different types of relationships: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many.

Introduction
Hibernate is an ORM framework for Java applications, simplifying database interaction by mapping Java classes to database tables. Understanding how to map relationships between entities is crucial for effective database modeling.

One-to-One Relationship
In a one-to-one relationship, each record in one entity corresponds to exactly one record in another entity. This is typically represented by having a foreign key column in one table referencing the primary key column of the other table.

One-to-Many Relationship
In a one-to-many relationship, each record in one entity can be associated with multiple records in another entity. This is commonly represented by having a foreign key column in the "many" side table referencing the primary key column of the "one" side table.

Many-to-One Relationship
In a many-to-one relationship, multiple records in one entity are associated with exactly one record in another entity. This is essentially the inverse of a one-to-many relationship, where the foreign key column resides in the "many" side table.

Many-to-Many Relationship
In a many-to-many relationship, multiple records in one entity can be associated with multiple records in another entity. This is achieved by introducing a join table that contains foreign key references to both entities, allowing for a many-to-many mapping between them.

Conclusion
Understanding how to map relationships between entities in Hibernate is essential for building robust and efficient applications. By leveraging these mappings effectively, developers can create well-structured and maintainable database schemas.
